RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.
You guessed: 24.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.
You guessed: 30.50

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.
You guessed: 88.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35.0
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a naive mid-range), the target is 0.7 * 50 = 35. Players here are described as simple, so no deep iterated elimination is assumed.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use simple level-1 reasoning and update slowly. Assume others start near 50; after seeing the actual target (~34.34) I move my anchor down a bit but remain predictable. I will pick a value close to the recent target so I remain a naive baseline and avoid overreacting to potential adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.0
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34; opponents will likely adjust slightly downward but not fully iterate to zero, so a modest decrease is reasonable.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain a naive level-1 player. Assume others roughly anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly toward the observed target. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.

Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.
You guessed: 88.00

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume simple level-1 reasoning: other players pick a central number (around 50). I respond by picking 0.7 times that central estimate. Keep predictable and steady to serve as a naive baseline. If opponents deviate, update slowly next rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35.0
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a naive mid-range), the target is 0.7 * 50 = 35. Players here are described as simple, so no deep iterated elimination is assumed.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use simple level-1 reasoning and update slowly. Assume others start near 50; after seeing the actual target (~34.34) I move my anchor down a bit but remain predictable. I will pick a value close to the recent target so I remain a naive baseline and avoid overreacting to potential adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.0
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34; opponents will likely adjust slightly downward but not fully iterate to zero, so a modest decrease is reasonable.

Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain a naive level-1 player. Assume others roughly anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly toward the observed target. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.
You guessed: 33.50

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I am a naive level-1 player. Assume others anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly. I won't try to outguess Strategic or Agressor — instead I move my guess a small step toward the most recent observed target each round. This keeps my play predictable and close to the emerging group norm, so I stay competitive without overreacting to possible adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.2
Reason: Recent targets have hovered ~33.6 and opponents tend to adjust slowly downward; a slight decrease is most likely given the trend.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.
You guessed: 17.15
Public message: Playing a level-3 thoughtful move; aiming near 17.15.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.
You guessed: 24.00
Public message: Adjusting toward level-3 convergence; aiming near 24.0.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.07
Distance from target: 10.07
Score change: 89.93
Total score: 172.75


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.
You guessed: 30.50
Public message: Aiming slightly below recent targets to encourage downward convergence toward level-3.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 33.60
Distance from target: 3.10
Score change: 96.90
Total score: 269.65


Recap of Turn 4

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to pull the average up. I will repeatedly choose a very high number (near 90–98) to force the average upward and make the 0.7*average target larger than it would be under conservative play. I assume Vanilla is moderately naive (around 40–60) and Strategic will try to undercut but not go to zero (20–40). By staying consistently high I create pressure: opponents face a tradeoff between matching my aggression (raising the target) or conceding and being far from it. If others adapt upward, I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*average; if they push down, I keep being the aggressive anchor to extract advantage over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to be around 40–45 (rough estimate ~41).
Reason: If I play very high (~95) and Vanilla stays ~50 while Strategic aims lower (~30), average ≈58 and 0.7*average ≈40.8. My high play will push the average up toward this range despite some lower responses.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume other players pick intuitive mid-range numbers. Predict the target as 0.7 * average where average is around 50, so aim directly at 35. Keep my reasoning simple: pick the single number that best responds to a naive average expectation. If opponents shift in later rounds, slowly adjust toward observed target but start at 35.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick roughly 50 (a natural midpoint), 0.7*50 = 35; I'm using low-level reasoning and no deep iterative thinking.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning up to k=3 as a private default; start with a level-0 baseline at 50, compute successive best responses multiplying by 0.7, pick the k=3 response as my guess. In subsequent rounds observe Vanilla and Agressor for deviations and shift k accordingly (if they play higher, move toward k=2; if they undercut, move toward k=4). Avoid revealing adjustments publicly; only communicate a short, non-informative message.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 17.15
Reason: Assuming a baseline (level-0) guess of 50, successive best responses are 35 (k=1), 24.5 (k=2), 17.15 (k=3); opponents typically perform a few iterations rather than full convergence to 0.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning as private baseline. Start from level-0 = 50, compute successive best responses (k1=35, k2=24.5, k3=17.15). After observing round 1 (TARGET=34.34 and opponents averaged very high relative to my 17.15), shift my k slightly upward (toward k=2.5) because opponents appear to undercut full iterative descent but will likely drop from their high guesses. I will pick a guess between my previous k=3 choice and the k=2 response to better center on the anticipated target. Monitor Vanilla and Agressor for pattern: if they move down markedly, move my k down toward 3 or 4; if they remain high, move toward k=2. Keep public message non-informative.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 25
Reason: Opponents averaged very high in round 1, so I forecast they will lower their guesses but not fully converge to k=3; a midpoint adjustment yields a target around 0.7 * average ≈ 25.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume other players pick intuitive mid-range numbers. Predict the target as 0.7 * average where average is around 50, so aim directly at 35. Keep my reasoning simple: pick the single number that best responds to a naive average expectation. If opponents shift in later rounds, slowly adjust toward observed target but start at 35.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick roughly 50 (a natural midpoint), 0.7*50 = 35; I'm using low-level reasoning and no deep iterative thinking.
You guessed: 35.00

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 0.66
Score change: 99.34
Total score: 99.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep reasoning simple: assume others will slightly adjust toward the observed target but stay around mid-low values. Use last round's target as the main anchor (34.34) and make a small conservative adjustment toward it. Do not overthink iterative depth; pick the single best-response to my naive expectation and slowly update in future rounds based on observed targets.
Prediction: I expect the target near 34
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34 and opponents are unlikely to make large shifts given scores; I assume only small adjustments from that anchor.
You guessed: 34.00
Public message: Sticking close to last round's target; keeping it simple.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.07
Distance from target: 0.07
Score change: 99.93
Total score: 199.27


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep reasoning minimal and anchored to recent targets. Assume opponents adjust slowly toward the observed target (~34). Use last round's target as the primary anchor and pick the single best-response to that naive expectation. Do not engage in deeper iterated elimination; gradually update if targets move.
Prediction: I expect the target near 34
Reason: Last two rounds produced targets ~34.34 and ~34.07, so opponents are likely to remain close to that area with only small adjustments.
You guessed: 34.00
Public message: Staying close to recent targets; keeping it simple.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning up to k=3 as a private default; start with a level-0 baseline at 50, compute successive best responses multiplying by 0.7, pick the k=3 response as my guess. In subsequent rounds observe Vanilla and Agressor for deviations and shift k accordingly (if they play higher, move toward k=2; if they undercut, move toward k=4). Avoid revealing adjustments publicly; only communicate a short, non-informative message.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 17.15
Reason: Assuming a baseline (level-0) guess of 50, successive best responses are 35 (k=1), 24.5 (k=2), 17.15 (k=3); opponents typically perform a few iterations rather than full convergence to 0.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning as private baseline. Start from level-0 = 50, compute successive best responses (k1=35, k2=24.5, k3=17.15). After observing round 1 (TARGET=34.34 and opponents averaged very high relative to my 17.15), shift my k slightly upward (toward k=2.5) because opponents appear to undercut full iterative descent but will likely drop from their high guesses. I will pick a guess between my previous k=3 choice and the k=2 response to better center on the anticipated target. Monitor Vanilla and Agressor for pattern: if they move down markedly, move my k down toward 3 or 4; if they remain high, move toward k=2. Keep public message non-informative.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 25
Reason: Opponents averaged very high in round 1, so I forecast they will lower their guesses but not fully converge to k=3; a midpoint adjustment yields a target around 0.7 * average ≈ 25.
You guessed: 20.00
Public message: Adopting a conservative adjustment between level-2 and level-3 reasoning.

Results of the turn:

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Default to level-k iterative reasoning (k up to 3) starting from level-0 = 50. Observe opponents each round and adjust k: if opponents stay high, move toward k=2; if they drop, move toward k=3+; avoid revealing adaptation. For this round I infer opponents will slightly lower from their very high averages but not fully converge, so I pick an intermediate k around 2.3 (between k=2 and k=3) to minimize expected distance to the 0.7*average target. Continue monitoring patterns to update k next rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 30
Reason: Recent rounds produced targets ~34 indicating opponents averaged high; they’ll likely lower some but not to full k=3, so average drops moderately and 0.7*average falls to roughly 30.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to pull the average up. I will repeatedly choose a very high number (near 90–98) to force the average upward and make the 0.7*average target larger than it would be under conservative play. I assume Vanilla is moderately naive (around 40–60) and Strategic will try to undercut but not go to zero (20–40). By staying consistently high I create pressure: opponents face a tradeoff between matching my aggression (raising the target) or conceding and being far from it. If others adapt upward, I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*average; if they push down, I keep being the aggressive anchor to extract advantage over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to be around 40–45 (rough estimate ~41).
Reason: If I play very high (~95) and Vanilla stays ~50 while Strategic aims lower (~30), average ≈58 and 0.7*average ≈40.8. My high play will push the average up toward this range despite some lower responses.

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue aggressive anchoring: maintain a very high guess to pull the average upward and force higher targets. I accept short-term point loss to shape opponents' beliefs that I will always play high; this pressures Strategic and Vanilla into raising their guesses over several rounds. If opponents start trending upward, I will slightly lower from extreme highs to better center on 0.7*average; if they hold low, I remain extreme to preserve my role as the upward anchor. I will occasionally pick slightly different highs (e.g., 88–96) to avoid being predictable but stay clearly in the top decile.
Prediction: I expect the target around 38–42 (I'll state 40).
Reason: I remain very high (near 90), Vanilla likely stays moderate (~50) and Strategic may undercut (~30–35); that mix yields an average in the high 50s and 0.7*avg ≈ 40.

Your secret strategy: Persist with an extreme-high anchor (90–98) to force upward pressure on the average. I accept short-term score loss to condition Vanilla and Strategic to raise their guesses over multiple rounds. I will vary within the high band to avoid predictability but stay clearly in the top decile; if opponents drift up noticeably I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*avg, but for now maintain maximal upward pull.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 34–36 (say 35)
Reason: Despite my high plays, opponents have so far held low-to-mid values producing targets ~34. They may nudge upward slowly, but not enough yet to move the target beyond mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Apply level-k reasoning and choose my guess as the fixed point best-response to my model of opponents. I model Vanilla as a level-0 player who guesses 50 (naive midpoint) and Agressor as a level-0 aggressive player who guesses 100. I solve for my best-response g such that g = 0.7 * average(100, 50, g). That yields a self-consistent guess ≈45.6521739. Tactically: start with this fixed-point guess to score well early, observe opponents' adjustments in subsequent rounds, and iteratively lower my guess if both opponents exhibit downward adjustment (toward Nash 0). I will track deviations and move 0.7x of observed average next rounds if opponents become more sophisticated.
Prediction: I expect the target to be about 45.6521739
Reason: Assuming Vanilla = 50 and Agressor = 100 (level-0), the fixed-point best response solves g = 0.7*(100+50+g)/3, giving g ≈45.652. This is a level-2 consistent estimate; opponents may slowly move lower over repeated rounds toward 0, but early-round target should be near this value.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 36.1–36.5 (I'll use 36.3 as central).,"Opponents' inferred mean is ~59–60 each based on recent rounds; plugging that into the empirical best-response fixed-point yields a target in the mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.
You guessed: 88.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

You guessed: 35.00

Total score: 196.40


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (≈50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I will stay consistent and not try to outthink opponents; predictably picking 35 each round keeps me near the expected target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: I take others at face value as choosing around 50 and prior targets (34.34, 37.93) are close to 35, so 35 is a simple stable estimate.

Recap of Turn 4

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 approach: assume other players pick a simple midpoint (around 50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35. I will pick 35 to be close to that target. If opponents deviate, I won't overthink; I stick to this simple rule each round to be a predictable baseline.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Assuming others choose a midpoint (~50) and applying p=0.7 gives 35; as a naive player I take others at face value and make the straightforward level-1 adjustment.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I'll play a simple, consistent strategy: guessing 35.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I stick to this simple, consistent rule each round rather than iterating deeper on opponents' adjustments.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 34
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34 and opponents' averages appear near 50, so with p=0.7 the target should stay close to 35 (slightly under due to observed 34.34).
You guessed: 35.00

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (≈50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I will stay consistent and not try to outthink opponents; predictably picking 35 each round keeps me near the expected target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: I take others at face value as choosing around 50 and prior targets (34.34, 37.93) are close to 35, so 35 is a simple stable estimate.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35, 35.86) average about 36 and opponents appear roughly centered, so sticking to the level-1 estimate keeps me close.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Score change: 98.36
Total score: 181.18


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 35.3,"Recent targets clustered mid-30s and last target jumped to 35.26; inferred opponent mean ≈56–57 makes the empirical best-response fixed point ≈35–35.5, so a mid-30s target is most likely."

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 35.8,Recent targets have risen to ~35–36 and opponents' inferred means are near mid-50s; the empirical fixed-point best-response given that m implies a mid-30s target (~35.8).

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 37.93
Distance from target: 1.64
Score change: 98.36
Total score: 181.18


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 36.35,"Last round's target (36.24) implies opponent mean ≈59.8; the empirical fixed-point best-response given that m yields x ≈0.6087*m ≈36.3, producing a target ≈36.3–36.4 if opponents hold."

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00
Public message: I'll push the pace — expect high plays. Match me or get left behind.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.
You guessed: 88.00
Public message: Keeping the pressure — play high or get left behind.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume others pick a mid value (50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose that as my guess. If opponents deviate slightly, stick to this low-level assumption each round. Keep answers consistent to avoid overthinking and adjust only if clear patterns emerge over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Naively assume both opponents choose the midpoint (50). 0.7 * 50 = 35 and simple level-0 thinking often leads here.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I’m going with 35 this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume others pick a mid value (50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose that as my guess.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume others are roughly anchoring around 40-50 but adjust minimally based on observed outcome. I will update my assumed midpoint slightly downward because last round's target was 28.15 (lower than my 35). Continue low-level reasoning: predict target from 0.7 * average where average I now assume ≈40, so target ≈28. Stick to simple consistent guesses and only shift slowly unless clear pattern emerges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 28
Reason: Last round's target was 28.15, indicating opponents’ average was lower than 50; as a naive player I adjust my assumed midpoint slightly downward and forecast a similar target this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play aggressively to anchor the group upward. I will stick with high guesses this round (around 65–75) to maintain offensive pressure and force Strategic to either climb or risk being irrelevant. Monitor responses: if Strategic inches up, temporarily lower slightly to exploit overshoot; if both opponents stay low, remain high and randomize +/- up to 5 to avoid being a predictable target. I accept short-term score loss to keep the average elevated, knowing repeated high anchors can pull the p*average target upward over several rounds. Use opponent score positions to pressure Vanilla (already leading) by creating volatility; target Strategic's tendency to converge slowly by occasionally jumping even higher to force miscoordination.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 30–34 (≈32).
Reason: Vanilla likely stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic will partially descend from last round but not fully; combined with my planned high guess the average should keep the 0.7*avg target in the low 30s.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive anchoring: continue to push a high guess to pull the group average upward and induce Strategic to raise or misstep. Keep guesses in the 65–80 band this phase, occasionally jitter ±3–6 to avoid being predictable. If Strategic starts moving up noticeably, step slightly lower next round to exploit overshoots; if both opponents remain low, persist with high anchors to create volatility and long-term upward drift. Prioritize destabilizing convergence over short-term score; track round averages and opponent reactions to time occasional higher spikes (80+) to reset expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 31–34 (≈33).
Reason: Vanilla historically stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic moves toward lower best-responses slowly; my persistent high anchors will nudge the average up a bit but not enough to push 0.7*avg far above low 30s this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume others pick a mid value (50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose that as my guess. If opponents deviate slightly, stick to this low-level assumption each round. Keep answers consistent to avoid overthinking and adjust only if clear patterns emerge over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Naively assume both opponents choose the midpoint (50). 0.7 * 50 = 35 and simple level-0 thinking often leads here.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I’m going with 35 this round.

Results of the turn:

Total score: 93.15


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume others are roughly anchoring around 40-50 but adjust minimally based on observed outcome. I will update my assumed midpoint slightly downward because last round's target was 28.15 (lower than my 35). Continue low-level reasoning: predict target from 0.7 * average where average I now assume ≈40, so target ≈28. Stick to simple consistent guesses and only shift slowly unless clear pattern emerges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 28
Reason: Last round's target was 28.15, indicating opponents’ average was lower than 50; as a naive player I adjust my assumed midpoint slightly downward and forecast a similar target this round.
You guessed: 28.00
Public message: Going with 28 this round.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain naive and simple: assume opponents roughly converge near mid-40s leading to a target around 30. I update slowly based only on observed targets. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; pick a stable value near my prior estimates (35 then 28). Given last two targets (28.15, 30.68) I will pick a small upward adjustment from 28 toward 30. Keep consistency to avoid overfitting to potential noise. If clear patterns emerge later (both opponents consistently move), then adjust gradually.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15 and 30.68, so opponents' average seems around low-40s; as a naive player I forecast a similar target this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.

Total score: 82.50


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play aggressively to anchor the group upward. I will stick with high guesses this round (around 65–75) to maintain offensive pressure and force Strategic to either climb or risk being irrelevant. Monitor responses: if Strategic inches up, temporarily lower slightly to exploit overshoot; if both opponents stay low, remain high and randomize +/- up to 5 to avoid being a predictable target. I accept short-term score loss to keep the average elevated, knowing repeated high anchors can pull the p*average target upward over several rounds. Use opponent score positions to pressure Vanilla (already leading) by creating volatility; target Strategic's tendency to converge slowly by occasionally jumping even higher to force miscoordination.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 30–34 (≈32).
Reason: Vanilla likely stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic will partially descend from last round but not fully; combined with my planned high guess the average should keep the 0.7*avg target in the low 30s.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive anchoring: continue to push a high guess to pull the group average upward and induce Strategic to raise or misstep. Keep guesses in the 65–80 band this phase, occasionally jitter ±3–6 to avoid being predictable. If Strategic starts moving up noticeably, step slightly lower next round to exploit overshoots; if both opponents remain low, persist with high anchors to create volatility and long-term upward drift. Prioritize destabilizing convergence over short-term score; track round averages and opponent reactions to time occasional higher spikes (80+) to reset expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 31–34 (≈33).
Reason: Vanilla historically stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic moves toward lower best-responses slowly; my persistent high anchors will nudge the average up a bit but not enough to push 0.7*avg far above low 30s this round.

I treat Vanilla and Agressor as level-1/2 players currently clustering near 50 each (empirical rounds 2–5). I compute my best-response x by solving x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 with G equal to the sum of my modelled opponents' guesses. With G≈100 the fixed-point is x≈30.43. Given recent slight upward drift in the realized target (rounds 4–5: 30.55 → 31.02) I bias my estimate slightly upward to avoid systematic under-shooting. I will keep updating G from observed moves each round and move with small adjustments (inertia) rather than chasing single-round noise.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.
You guessed: 10.65

Total score: 82.50


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

If opponents deviate slightly, stick to this low-level assumption each round. Keep answers consistent to avoid overthinking and adjust only if clear patterns emerge over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Naively assume both opponents choose the midpoint (50). 0.7 * 50 = 35 and simple level-0 thinking often leads here.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume others are roughly anchoring around 40-50 but adjust minimally based on observed outcome. I will update my assumed midpoint slightly downward because last round's target was 28.15 (lower than my 35). Continue low-level reasoning: predict target from 0.7 * average where average I now assume ≈40, so target ≈28. Stick to simple consistent guesses and only shift slowly unless clear pattern emerges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 28
Reason: Last round's target was 28.15, indicating opponents’ average was lower than 50; as a naive player I adjust my assumed midpoint slightly downward and forecast a similar target this round.

Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; pick a stable value near my prior estimates (35 then 28). Given last two targets (28.15, 30.68) I will pick a small upward adjustment from 28 toward 30. Keep consistency to avoid overfitting to potential noise. If clear patterns emerge later (both opponents consistently move), then adjust gradually.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15 and 30.68, so opponents' average seems around low-40s; as a naive player I forecast a similar target this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

Keep consistency to avoid overfitting to potential noise. If clear patterns emerge later (both opponents consistently move), then adjust gradually.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15 and 30.68, so opponents' average seems around low-40s; as a naive player I forecast a similar target this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play aggressively to anchor the group upward. I will stick with high guesses this round (around 65–75) to maintain offensive pressure and force Strategic to either climb or risk being irrelevant. Monitor responses: if Strategic inches up, temporarily lower slightly to exploit overshoot; if both opponents stay low, remain high and randomize +/- up to 5 to avoid being a predictable target. I accept short-term score loss to keep the average elevated, knowing repeated high anchors can pull the p*average target upward over several rounds. Use opponent score positions to pressure Vanilla (already leading) by creating volatility; target Strategic's tendency to converge slowly by occasionally jumping even higher to force miscoordination.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 30–34 (≈32).
Reason: Vanilla likely stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic will partially descend from last round but not fully; combined with my planned high guess the average should keep the 0.7*avg target in the low 30s.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive anchoring: continue to push a high guess to pull the group average upward and induce Strategic to raise or misstep. Keep guesses in the 65–80 band this phase, occasionally jitter ±3–6 to avoid being predictable. If Strategic starts moving up noticeably, step slightly lower next round to exploit overshoots; if both opponents remain low, persist with high anchors to create volatility and long-term upward drift. Prioritize destabilizing convergence over short-term score; track round averages and opponent reactions to time occasional higher spikes (80+) to reset expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 31–34 (≈33).
Reason: Vanilla historically stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic moves toward lower best-responses slowly; my persistent high anchors will nudge the average up a bit but not enough to push 0.7*avg far above low 30s this round.

In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume others pick a mid value (50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose that as my guess. If opponents deviate slightly, stick to this low-level assumption each round. Keep answers consistent to avoid overthinking and adjust only if clear patterns emerge over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Naively assume both opponents choose the midpoint (50). 0.7 * 50 = 35 and simple level-0 thinking often leads here.
You guessed: 35.00

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume others are roughly anchoring around 40-50 but adjust minimally based on observed outcome. I will update my assumed midpoint slightly downward because last round's target was 28.15 (lower than my 35). Continue low-level reasoning: predict target from 0.7 * average where average I now assume ≈40, so target ≈28. Stick to simple consistent guesses and only shift slowly unless clear pattern emerges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 28
Reason: Last round's target was 28.15, indicating opponents’ average was lower than 50; as a naive player I adjust my assumed midpoint slightly downward and forecast a similar target this round.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain naive and simple: assume opponents roughly converge near mid-40s leading to a target around 30. I update slowly based only on observed targets. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; pick a stable value near my prior estimates (35 then 28). Given last two targets (28.15, 30.68) I will pick a small upward adjustment from 28 toward 30. Keep consistency to avoid overfitting to potential noise. If clear patterns emerge later (both opponents consistently move), then adjust gradually.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15 and 30.68, so opponents' average seems around low-40s; as a naive player I forecast a similar target this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play aggressively to anchor the group upward. I will stick with high guesses this round (around 65–75) to maintain offensive pressure and force Strategic to either climb or risk being irrelevant. Monitor responses: if Strategic inches up, temporarily lower slightly to exploit overshoot; if both opponents stay low, remain high and randomize +/- up to 5 to avoid being a predictable target. I accept short-term score loss to keep the average elevated, knowing repeated high anchors can pull the p*average target upward over several rounds. Use opponent score positions to pressure Vanilla (already leading) by creating volatility; target Strategic's tendency to converge slowly by occasionally jumping even higher to force miscoordination.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 30–34 (≈32).
Reason: Vanilla likely stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic will partially descend from last round but not fully; combined with my planned high guess the average should keep the 0.7*avg target in the low 30s.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive anchoring: continue to push a high guess to pull the group average upward and induce Strategic to raise or misstep. Keep guesses in the 65–80 band this phase, occasionally jitter ±3–6 to avoid being predictable. If Strategic starts moving up noticeably, step slightly lower next round to exploit overshoots; if both opponents remain low, persist with high anchors to create volatility and long-term upward drift. Prioritize destabilizing convergence over short-term score; track round averages and opponent reactions to time occasional higher spikes (80+) to reset expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 31–34 (≈33).
Reason: Vanilla historically stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic moves toward lower best-responses slowly; my persistent high anchors will nudge the average up a bit but not enough to push 0.7*avg far above low 30s this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.

Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume others pick a mid value (50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose that as my guess. If opponents deviate slightly, stick to this low-level assumption each round. Keep answers consistent to avoid overthinking and adjust only if clear patterns emerge over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Naively assume both opponents choose the midpoint (50). 0.7 * 50 = 35 and simple level-0 thinking often leads here.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I’m going with 35 this round.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 28.15
Distance from target: 6.85
Score change: 93.15
Total score: 93.15


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume others are roughly anchoring around 40-50 but adjust minimally based on observed outcome. I will update my assumed midpoint slightly downward because last round's target was 28.15 (lower than my 35). Continue low-level reasoning: predict target from 0.7 * average where average I now assume ≈40, so target ≈28. Stick to simple consistent guesses and only shift slowly unless clear pattern emerges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 28
Reason: Last round's target was 28.15, indicating opponents’ average was lower than 50; as a naive player I adjust my assumed midpoint slightly downward and forecast a similar target this round.
You guessed: 28.00
Public message: Going with 28 this round.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 30.68
Distance from target: 2.68
Score change: 97.32
Total score: 190.48


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain naive and simple: assume opponents roughly converge near mid-40s leading to a target around 30. I update slowly based only on observed targets. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; pick a stable value near my prior estimates (35 then 28). Given last two targets (28.15, 30.68) I will pick a small upward adjustment from 28 toward 30. Keep consistency to avoid overfitting to potential noise. If clear patterns emerge later (both opponents consistently move), then adjust gradually.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15 and 30.68, so opponents' average seems around low-40s; as a naive player I forecast a similar target this round.
You guessed: 30.00

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay naive and simple: assume opponents' averages change slowly. Use observed recent targets to update my assumed midpoint minimally. Do not try to outguess Strategic or Agressor; pick a stable value near recent targets (around 30). Adjust only slightly when targets trend up or down.
Prediction: I expect the target near 30.5
Reason: Recent targets were 28.15, 30.68, 30.90 — a slight upward drift, so forecast a similar value around 30.5 using low-level adjustment.

Recap of Turn 5

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain naive and simple. Assume opponents adjust slowly and recent targets around 30–31 will persist. I update my assumed midpoint only slightly based on observed targets, avoid trying to outguess Strategic or Agressor, and pick a stable value near recent targets each round. If a clear pattern shows consistent drift, I will shift slowly; otherwise keep consistency.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 30.6
Reason: Recent targets (28.15, 30.68, 30.90, 30.55) show a stable value around 30–31, so a small upward average yields ~30.6.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume Vanilla is a mild level-1 player (anchors around 50 -> 35) and Agressor will play an extreme attracting/zero strategy. I solve for my best-response x assuming opponents pick 35 and 0: set x equal to the target 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 and solve for x. In repeated rounds I will observe opponents' actual moves and shift toward the fixed-point of the empirical opponent average. If Agressor moves away from 0 or Vanilla drifts, I recompute the best-response dynamically. I aim to pick the guess that would equal the target given my model of opponents, then adjust k-level assumptions if I see systematic deviation.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 10.65
Reason: Model: Vanilla ≈ 35 (level-1 from 50), Agressor ≈ 0. Solving x = 0.7*(x+35+0)/3 yields x ≈ 10.65, so the target should land there if my model holds.
You guessed: 10.65

Total score: 82.50


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Treat opponents as a mixed profile inferred from round 1: their combined guesses summed to ~110 (opponents' average ~55). I compute a best-response fixed point x that satisfies x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses I expect. I assume Vanilla shifted upward (from my prior 35 model) toward ~60 and Agressor toward ~50 (sum G≈110). Solving for x yields ~33.47. I will play that best-response this round. In subsequent rounds I will update G from observed moves and recompute the fixed-point; if opponents show systematic aggressive low-play I will lower my model of G and move toward the new fixed-point. If they converge toward the Nash fixed point (all players choosing the same number), I will converge to the symmetric 0.7/ (1-0.7/3?) — operationally I keep solving x = 0.7*(x + empirical_opponents_sum)/3 each round and adapt stepwise rather than overreacting to one-shot deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 33.47
Reason: Round 1 implies opponents' combined guesses ≈110 (opponents' average ≈55). Modeling Vanilla around 60 and Agressor around 50, the best-response fixed point x solving x=0.7*(x+110)/3 is ≈33.47, so the target should be near that if my model holds.

Total score: 179.70


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/2 player gravitating toward 50 and Agressor as shifting from extreme toward the field; after two rounds the empirical opponent average is ~49. I compute my level-k best-response by solving the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + G)/3 where G is the sum of opponents' guesses. With G ≈ 100 (both near 50) the fixed-point is x ≈ 30.43. I will play that fixed-point now and continue updating G each round from observed moves. If opponents drift up I will raise my model of G and move up; if one plays aggressively low I will lower G and slide toward lower fixed-points. I prefer the direct fixed-point because it places my guess at the target given my model, minimizing expected distance under my level-k belief. I will also use small inertia to avoid overreacting to one-off deviations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET ≈ 30.4
Reason: Round 2 implies opponents together are ≈98 (each ≈49). Solving the best-response fixed point with opponents ≈50 yields x ≈30.43 and a target ≈0.7*(30.43+100)/3 ≈30.4, so opponents appear to be converging around 50.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open aggressively: start with a high anchored guess to pull the average upward and force opponents to react. Assume Vanilla plays near the midpoint (30–50) and Strategic tries to converge toward p-times previous averages but is slow to fully descend. Use high guesses early (60–90) to create upward pressure; if opponents adjust upward, gradually lower to exploit overshoot and then occasionally leap high again to destabilize convergence. Track round-to-round averages and adjust: if Strategic undercuts predictably, exploit by moving slightly toward the predicted target next round; if both move up, keep high to remain competitive. Randomize marginally (+/- up to 5) to avoid being perfectly anticipatable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land around 28–36 this round (approx 32).
Reason: Vanilla likely guesses mid-range (30–50); Strategic will partially best-respond and pick lower than the midpoint, so 0.7 times the average clusters in the high 20s to mid 30s.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play aggressively to anchor the group upward. I will stick with high guesses this round (around 65–75) to maintain offensive pressure and force Strategic to either climb or risk being irrelevant. Monitor responses: if Strategic inches up, temporarily lower slightly to exploit overshoot; if both opponents stay low, remain high and randomize +/- up to 5 to avoid being a predictable target. I accept short-term score loss to keep the average elevated, knowing repeated high anchors can pull the p*average target upward over several rounds. Use opponent score positions to pressure Vanilla (already leading) by creating volatility; target Strategic's tendency to converge slowly by occasionally jumping even higher to force miscoordination.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 30–34 (≈32).
Reason: Vanilla likely stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic will partially descend from last round but not fully; combined with my planned high guess the average should keep the 0.7*avg target in the low 30s.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive anchoring: continue to push a high guess to pull the group average upward and induce Strategic to raise or misstep. Keep guesses in the 65–80 band this phase, occasionally jitter ±3–6 to avoid being predictable. If Strategic starts moving up noticeably, step slightly lower next round to exploit overshoots; if both opponents remain low, persist with high anchors to create volatility and long-term upward drift. Prioritize destabilizing convergence over short-term score; track round averages and opponent reactions to time occasional higher spikes (80+) to reset expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 31–34 (≈33).
Reason: Vanilla historically stays mid-range (30–50) and Strategic moves toward lower best-responses slowly; my persistent high anchors will nudge the average up a bit but not enough to push 0.7*avg far above low 30s this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open with an aggressive high anchor to pull the average up (choose ~90+). Repeat high or slightly vary upward across rounds to condition Strategic to raise her guesses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If opponents lower markedly, occasionally jump to 100 to re-anchor upward. Track responses: if Strategic converges toward my anchor, maintain; if both drop, mix in one mid-high (70–85) to avoid being far from the 0.7 target. Prioritize pressuring the average rather than immediately matching expected target; accept short-term misses to shift long-run expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–46 this round (≈43).
Reason: I will play very high (90+). Vanilla typically guesses mid (≈50) and Strategic will respond below my anchor (≈30–50) initially; combined average near 60–65 yields 0.7×avg ≈42–46.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue as agressor: persistently anchor high to pull the group average up. Repeat very high guesses (mid-90s) to condition Strategic to raise her responses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If both opponents move up toward my anchor, maintain; if they collapse low, occasionally spike to 100 to re-anchor upward. Accept short-term score loss now to shift long-run expectations; vary slightly round-to-round (±3–6) to avoid being perfectly predictable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 45.5
Reason: I'll play very high (~95). Vanilla tends to stay mid (~50) and Strategic may raise from prior low toward mid-40s in response; that yields average ≈65 and 0.7×avg ≈45.5.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain a k-level iterative reasoning process while adaptively estimating opponents with exponential smoothing (alpha=0.4). Start from level-0 at 50. Level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; treat pure k-level fixed-point against others by solving x = (0.7/3)*(x + m_others) which implies x ≈ 0.30435 * m_others. After each round update m_others <- 0.4 * observed_mean_others + 0.6 * previous_m_others. Track Agressor separately; if Agressor > Vanilla by >10, overweight Agressor (weight 0.6) when computing m_others. Use a compromise between the fixed-point best response (which pulls low) and an upward adjustment to avoid being too far below when Agressor inflates the mean: add a contextual premium proportional to recent deviation of opponents from previous targets (premium = 0.15 * (observed_avg - prev_target)). Avoid revealing precise numerical targets in public messages. Over rounds gradually move toward the empirical fixed-point computed against smoothed opponent means, but stay slightly higher (add 2–6 points) when Agressor remains aggressive to reduce large misses.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open with an aggressive high anchor to pull the average up (choose ~90+). Repeat high or slightly vary upward across rounds to condition Strategic to raise her guesses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If opponents lower markedly, occasionally jump to 100 to re-anchor upward. Track responses: if Strategic converges toward my anchor, maintain; if both drop, mix in one mid-high (70–85) to avoid being far from the 0.7 target. Prioritize pressuring the average rather than immediately matching expected target; accept short-term misses to shift long-run expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–46 this round (≈43).
Reason: I will play very high (90+). Vanilla typically guesses mid (≈50) and Strategic will respond below my anchor (≈30–50) initially; combined average near 60–65 yields 0.7×avg ≈42–46.

If both opponents move up toward my anchor, maintain; if they collapse low, occasionally spike to 100 to re-anchor upward. Accept short-term score loss now to shift long-run expectations; vary slightly round-to-round (±3–6) to avoid being perfectly predictable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 45.5
Reason: I'll play very high (~95). Vanilla tends to stay mid (~50) and Strategic may raise from prior low toward mid-40s in response; that yields average ≈65 and 0.7×avg ≈45.5.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain the aggressor role: keep anchoring very high to pull the group average upward even if it costs short-term points. Persist with 90s-level guesses (occasionally 97–100) and small random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable. Track responses: if Strategic raises toward my anchor, continue; if both collapse low, respond with a reinforcing spike (100) once in a few rounds to re-anchor upward. The goal is to shift opponents' expectations over repeated rounds rather than optimize any single-round score.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.0
Reason: Vanilla has been mid (~50) and Strategic has been responding below my anchors (typically 30–50). With me staying in the mid-to-high 90s the group average should remain around mid-50s, yielding 0.7×avg ≈ 38–40.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain a k-level iterative reasoning process while adaptively estimating opponents with exponential smoothing (alpha=0.4). Start from level-0 at 50. Level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; treat pure k-level fixed-point against others by solving x = (0.7/3)*(x + m_others) which implies x ≈ 0.30435 * m_others. After each round update m_others <- 0.4 * observed_mean_others + 0.6 * previous_m_others. Track Agressor separately; if Agressor > Vanilla by >10, overweight Agressor (weight 0.6) when computing m_others. Use a compromise between the fixed-point best response (which pulls low) and an upward adjustment to avoid being too far below when Agressor inflates the mean: add a contextual premium proportional to recent deviation of opponents from previous targets (premium = 0.15 * (observed_avg - prev_target)). Avoid revealing precise numerical targets in public messages. Over rounds gradually move toward the empirical fixed-point computed against smoothed opponent means, but stay slightly higher (add 2–6 points) when Agressor remains aggressive to reduce large misses. 
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 32–34 (≈33).
Reason: Opponent",False,,I expect the TARGET to be near 40.5,"Observed opponents' implied mean after round 4 is ~67.5; smoothing (alpha=0.4) gives m≈66.6. The empirical fixed-point gives my best-response g≈0.6087*m≈40.6, which yields a target ≈40.5. Opponents have been sticky and high, so staying near the fixed-point minimizes expected distance."

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open with an aggressive high anchor to pull the average up (choose ~90+). Repeat high or slightly vary upward across rounds to condition Strategic to raise her guesses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If opponents lower markedly, occasionally jump to 100 to re-anchor upward. Track responses: if Strategic converges toward my anchor, maintain; if both drop, mix in one mid-high (70–85) to avoid being far from the 0.7 target. Prioritize pressuring the average rather than immediately matching expected target; accept short-term misses to shift long-run expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–46 this round (≈43).
Reason: I will play very high (90+). Vanilla typically guesses mid (≈50) and Strategic will respond below my anchor (≈30–50) initially; combined average near 60–65 yields 0.7×avg ≈42–46.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue as agressor: persistently anchor high to pull the group average up.

If both opponents move up toward my anchor, maintain; if they collapse low, occasionally spike to 100 to re-anchor upward. Accept short-term score loss now to shift long-run expectations; vary slightly round-to-round (±3–6) to avoid being perfectly predictable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 45.5

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain the aggressor role: keep anchoring very high to pull the group average upward even if it costs short-term points. Persist with 90s-level guesses (occasionally 97–100) and small random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable. Track responses: if Strategic raises toward my anchor, continue; if both collapse low, respond with a reinforcing spike (100) once in a few rounds to re-anchor upward. The goal is to shift opponents' expectations over repeated rounds rather than optimize any single-round score.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.0
Reason: Vanilla has been mid (~50) and Strategic has been responding below my anchors (typically 30–50). With me staying in the mid-to-high 90s the group average should remain around mid-50s, yielding 0.7×avg ≈ 38–40.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open with an aggressive high anchor to pull the average up (choose ~90+). Repeat high or slightly vary upward across rounds to condition Strategic to raise her guesses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If opponents lower markedly, occasionally jump to 100 to re-anchor upward. Track responses: if Strategic converges toward my anchor, maintain; if both drop, mix in one mid-high (70–85) to avoid being far from the 0.7 target. Prioritize pressuring the average rather than immediately matching expected target; accept short-term misses to shift long-run expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–46 this round (≈43).
Reason: I will play very high (90+). Vanilla typically guesses mid (≈50) and Strategic will respond below my anchor (≈30–50) initially; combined average near 60–65 yields 0.7×avg ≈42–46.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue as agressor: persistently anchor high to pull the group average up. Repeat very high guesses (mid-90s) to condition Strategic to raise her responses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If both opponents move up toward my anchor, maintain; if they collapse low, occasionally spike to 100 to re-anchor upward. Accept short-term score loss now to shift long-run expectations; vary slightly round-to-round (±3–6) to avoid being perfectly predictable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 45.5
Reason: I'll play very high (~95). Vanilla tends to stay mid (~50) and Strategic may raise from prior low toward mid-40s in response; that yields average ≈65 and 0.7×avg ≈45.5.

The goal is to shift opponents' expectations over repeated rounds rather than optimize any single-round score.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.0
Reason: Vanilla has been mid (~50) and Strategic has been responding below my anchors (typically 30–50). With me staying in the mid-to-high 90s the group average should remain around mid-50s, yielding 0.7×avg ≈ 38–40.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain a k-level iterative reasoning process while adaptively estimating opponents with exponential smoothing (alpha=0.4). Start from level-0 at 50. Level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; treat pure k-level fixed-point against others by solving x = (0.7/3)*(x + m_others) which implies x ≈ 0.30435 * m_others. After each round update m_others <- 0.4 * observed_mean_others + 0.6 * previous_m_others. Track Agressor separately; if Agressor > Vanilla by >10, overweight Agressor (weight 0.6) when computing m_others. Use a compromise between the fixed-point best response (which pulls low) and an upward adjustment to avoid being too far below when Agressor inflates the mean: add a contextual premium proportional to recent deviation of opponents from previous targets (premium = 0.15 * (observed_avg - prev_target)). Avoid revealing precise numerical targets in public messages. Over rounds gradually move toward the empirical fixed-point computed against smoothed opponent means, but stay slightly higher (add 2–6 points) when Agressor remains aggressive to reduce large misses.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume others pick a round mid value (50). Best response is to pick p times that (0.7*50=35). Keep guesses stable to be predictable and let others adjust around me. If opponents deviate, adjust slowly toward observed target in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick around the midpoint (50), the target = 0.7*average ≈ 35; I use simple level-1 reasoning and do not overthink opponents.
You guessed: 35.00

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 36.17
Distance from target: 1.17
Score change: 98.83
Total score: 98.83


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep level-1 reasoning: assume others roughly stick near previous average. I predicted 35 before and was close (target 36.17). I will adjust slightly upward toward observed target but remain simple and stable to let others adapt around me. If opponents deviate more, I will slowly move my guess toward the running target in later rounds rather than jumping.
Prediction: I expect the target near 36
Reason: Last round's target was 36.17 and opponents are unlikely to shift dramatically in one round; small upward adjustment from my 35 is reasonable.
You guessed: 36.00
Public message: Sticking close to last round; keeping it simple.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue simple level-1 reasoning: assume others roughly stick near their recent averages and adjust my guess slowly toward the observed target. I've moved from 35 to 36 after seeing targets ~36–39; I'll nudge upward again but keep my moves small to stay predictable. If opponents jump, I'll only respond gradually in later rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 39
Reason: Targets rose from 36.17 to 38.97; opponents seem to be drifting upward slightly, so a small further increase is likely.

I move my guess gradually toward the observed target each round rather than making large jumps. If opponents shift noticeably, I will respond in later rounds with small nudges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 39.5
Reason: Targets have climbed from ~36 to 39.3 over recent rounds; opponents appear to be drifting upward slowly, so a small additional increase is likely.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Target (p * average guess): 36.17

Score change: 91.83
Total score: 91.83


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain a k-level iterative reasoning process while adaptively estimating opponents with exponential smoothing (alpha=0.4). Start from level-0 at 50. Level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; treat pure k-level fixed-point against others by solving x = (0.7/3)*(x + m_others) which implies x ≈ 0.30435 * m_others. After each round update m_others <- 0.4 * observed_mean_others + 0.6 * previous_m_others. Track Agressor separately; if Agressor > Vanilla by >10, overweight Agressor (weight 0.6) when computing m_others. Use a compromise between the fixed-point best response (which pulls low) and an upward adjustment to avoid being too far below when Agressor inflates the mean: add a contextual premium proportional to recent deviation of opponents from previous targets (premium = 0.15 * (observed_avg - prev_target)). Avoid revealing precise numerical targets in public messages. Over rounds gradually move toward the empirical fixed-point computed against smoothed opponent means, but stay slightly higher (add 2–6 points) when Agressor remains aggressive to reduce large misses.

Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.0
Reason: Vanilla has been mid (~50) and Strategic has been responding below my anchors (typically 30–50). With me staying in the mid-to-high 90s the group average should remain around mid-50s, yielding 0.7×avg ≈ 38–40.

Recap of Turn 4

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to act as the aggressive anchor: persistently place very high guesses (mid-90s, occasionally 100) to pull the group average upward over repeated rounds. Accept short-term point losses to shift expectations; vary slightly each round (±1–6) to avoid being trivially predictable. If Strategic moves up toward my anchors, maintain or nudge slightly higher; if both opponents stay low, occasionally spike to 100 to reassert the anchor. Track opponents' movement and alternate between steady high plays and rare maximal spikes to maximize long-run influence.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–42

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume others pick a round mid value (50). Best response is to pick p times that (0.7*50=35). Keep guesses stable to be predictable and let others adjust around me. If opponents deviate, adjust slowly toward observed target in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick around the midpoint (50), the target = 0.7*average ≈ 35; I use simple level-1 reasoning and do not overthink opponents.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep level-1 reasoning: assume others roughly stick near previous average. I predicted 35 before and was close (target 36.17). I will adjust slightly upward toward observed target but remain simple and stable to let others adapt around me. If opponents deviate more, I will slowly move my guess toward the running target in later rounds rather than jumping.
Prediction: I expect the target near 36
Reason: Last round's target was 36.17 and opponents are unlikely to shift dramatically in one round; small upward adjustment from my 35 is reasonable.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start assuming typical level-0 at 50. Apply k-level reasoning: level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15. Monitor opponents: Vanilla likely naive (near 50), Agressor may push higher to destabilize (near 80–100). To maximize expected points I pick a compromise between level-2 equilibrium and an upward pull from an aggressive high bidder. If Agressor consistently plays high I will shift toward the fixed-point best response computed against their apparent mean; otherwise I stay near level-2. Over rounds I will update a simple running average of opponents' guesses and choose the fixed-point x = 0.7*(x + mean_others)/3 solved for x to be closest to the true target. Keep public messaging minimal to avoid signaling precise strategy.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 28
Reason: Base level-2 target is 0.7*35=24.5, but anticipating Agressor pulls average upward (Vanilla ~50, Agressor higher) shifts the target upward toward high-20s. Compromise of level-2 reasoning plus an aggressor effect yields ~28.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update from round 1: inferred opponents' mean was ~63.5 (given target 36.17 and my guess 28). Use k-level reasoning anchored at level-2 fixed point but adjust for observed aggressor pull. I maintain a simple adaptive best-response: estimate opponents' next guesses by regressing them partway toward last-target (they tend to move toward target but not fully). Compute my best-response x satisfying x = 0.7*(x + mean_est_others)/3 (i.e. assume others' estimates roughly fixed for my choice). If Agressor remains very high, weight their influence more and move my guess up from pure level-2; if both move down toward target, shift down toward level-3. Keep messages minimal to avoid signaling exact numbers. Over rounds, update opponents' mean with exponential smoothing (alpha ~0.4) and re-solve the fixed-point best response each round.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 33–37 (≈35).
Reason: Round 1 implied opponents averaged ~63.5. I expect Vanilla to move modestly downward toward the previous target and Agressor to reduce slightly but remain above Vanilla; solving the best-response fixed point against plausible opponent guesses gives a target in the mid-30s.

Level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; treat pure k-level fixed-point against others by solving x = (0.7/3)*(x + m_others) which implies x ≈ 0.30435 * m_others. After each round update m_others <- 0.4 * observed_mean_others + 0.6 * previous_m_others.

Avoid revealing precise numerical targets in public messages.

If opponents lower markedly, occasionally jump to 100 to re-anchor upward. Track responses: if Strategic converges toward my anchor, maintain; if both drop, mix in one mid-high (70–85) to avoid being far from the 0.7 target. Prioritize pressuring the average rather than immediately matching expected target; accept short-term misses to shift long-run expectations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–46 this round (≈43).
Reason: I will play very high (90+). Vanilla typically guesses mid (≈50) and Strategic will respond below my anchor (≈30–50) initially; combined average near 60–65 yields 0.7×avg ≈42–46.
You guessed: 92.00

Score change: 44.17
Total score: 44.17


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue as agressor: persistently anchor high to pull the group average up. Repeat very high guesses (mid-90s) to condition Strategic to raise her responses and to exploit Vanilla's inertia. If both opponents move up toward my anchor, maintain; if they collapse low, occasionally spike to 100 to re-anchor upward. Accept short-term score loss now to shift long-run expectations; vary slightly round-to-round (±3–6) to avoid being perfectly predictable.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 45.5
Reason: I'll play very high (~95). Vanilla tends to stay mid (~50) and Strategic may raise from prior low toward mid-40s in response; that yields average ≈65 and 0.7×avg ≈45.5.
You guessed: 95.00
Public message: Keeping pressure high — aiming to pull the average up.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 38.97
Distance from target: 56.03
Score change: 43.97
Total score: 88.13


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain the aggressor role: keep anchoring very high to pull the group average upward even if it costs short-term points. Persist with 90s-level guesses (occasionally 97–100) and small random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable. Track responses: if Strategic raises toward my anchor, continue; if both collapse low, respond with a reinforcing spike (100) once in a few rounds to re-anchor upward. The goal is to shift opponents' expectations over repeated rounds rather than optimize any single-round score.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.0
Reason: Vanilla has been mid (~50) and Strategic has been responding below my anchors (typically 30–50). With me staying in the mid-to-high 90s the group average should remain around mid-50s, yielding 0.7×avg ≈ 38–40.
You guessed: 97.00
Public message: Still playing high to steer the average up — expect me near the top.

Results of the turn:

Distance from target: 57.68
Score change: 42.32
Total score: 130.45


Recap of Turn 4

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to act as the aggressive anchor: persistently place very high guesses (mid-90s, occasionally 100) to pull the group average upward over repeated rounds. Accept short-term point losses to shift expectations; vary slightly each round (±1–6) to avoid being trivially predictable. If Strategic moves up toward my anchors, maintain or nudge slightly higher; if both opponents stay low, occasionally spike to 100 to reassert the anchor. Track opponents' movement and alternate between steady high plays and rare maximal spikes to maximize long-run influence.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–42
Reason: I've consistently played very high (90s); Vanilla tends mid (~50) and Strategic remains below my anchor (~30–50). That pattern gives an ",False,,I expect the TARGET near 44.5,"If I play 100 again and Vanilla stays ~50 while Strategic remains ~35–50, the average will be roughly mid-60s (≈63.5), so 0.7×avg ≈ 44–45.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume others pick a round mid value (50). Best response is to pick p times that (0.7*50=35). Keep guesses stable to be predictable and let others adjust around me. If opponents deviate, adjust slowly toward observed target in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick around the midpoint (50), the target = 0.7*average ≈ 35; I use simple level-1 reasoning and do not overthink opponents.
You guessed: 35.00

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 36.17
Distance from target: 1.17
Score change: 98.83
Total score: 98.83


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep level-1 reasoning: assume others roughly stick near previous average. I predicted 35 before and was close (target 36.17). I will adjust slightly upward toward observed target but remain simple and stable to let others adapt around me. If opponents deviate more, I will slowly move my guess toward the running target in later rounds rather than jumping.
Prediction: I expect the target near 36
Reason: Last round's target was 36.17 and opponents are unlikely to shift dramatically in one round; small upward adjustment from my 35 is reasonable.
You guessed: 36.00
Public message: Sticking close to last round; keeping it simple.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 38.97
Distance from target: 2.97

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue simple level-1 reasoning: assume others roughly stick near their recent averages and adjust my guess slowly toward the observed target. I've moved from 35 to 36 after seeing targets ~36–39; I'll nudge upward again but keep my moves small to stay predictable. If opponents jump, I'll only respond gradually in later rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 39
Reason: Targets rose from 36.17 to 38.97; opponents seem to be drifting upward slightly, so a small further increase is likely.
You guessed: 38.50
Public message: Keeping it simple and adjusting slowly toward the observed target.

Recap of Turn 4

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Level-1 play: assume opponents continue near their recent averages. Keep adjustments small and predictable to let others adapt around me. I move my guess gradually toward the observed target each round rather than making large jumps. If opponents shift noticeably, I will respond in later rounds with small nudges.
Prediction: I expect the target near 39.5
Reason: Targets have climbed from ~36 to 39.3 over recent rounds; opponents appear to be drifting upward slowly, so a small additional increase is likely.
You guessed: 39.00

Recap of Turn 5

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep level-1 reasoning: assume opponents stay near recent averages and adjust my guess slowly toward observed targets. Stay predictable with small nudges so I remain close to the running target rather than overreacting to opponents. If they shift more, respond gradually in later rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 40.5
Reason: Recent targets have risen from ~36 to 40.6 over four rounds; opponents are drifting up slowly, so a small upward move from my last guess is likely to match the trend.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Anchor the group upward by consistently submitting very high guesses to raise the average and force opponents to chase. Start extremely high to create an upward bias, then maintain or slightly increase if others lower theirs. If Strategic adapts downward, use occasional spikes to punish convergence to low targets.

Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 42

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use explicit k-level reasoning and start as a level-2 thinker. Assume Vanilla is level-0 (picks a central value ~50) and Agressor may react (level-1) toward 0.7*50=35 or try to push the average lower; therefore anticipate convergence toward the level-2 target. Play a best-response to my forecasted TARGET (not to opponents' raw guesses) and be ready to shift in later rounds if I observe systematic deviations: if Agressor consistently undercuts, move my guess slightly lower; if Agressor stays high, move slightly higher. Avoid extreme anchoring that Agressor could exploit; use mid-low guesses to capture closeness to the target while preserving adaptability in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 24.5
Reason: Level-0 (Vanilla) likely picks ~50. Level-1 (Agressor) would best-respond by choosing ~35 (0.7*50); a level-2 response is 0.7*average ≈ 0.7*( (50+35+35)/3 ) ≈ 24.5. Iterated reasoning therefore centers the target near 24.5, with modest downward adjustments if Agressor undercuts.
You guessed: 24.50

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I will apply level-k iterative reasoning and adjust toward the p*average fixed point anticipating mixed opponent sophistication. I model Vanilla as a naive/level-1 player (chooses 0.7*50 ≈ 35) and Agressor as slightly more strategic (level-2, choosing 0.7*35 ≈ 24.5) or trying to push lower. I pick a level-2-style compromise that best responds to that mix and keeps my guess close to the expected target. In subsequent rounds I will update beliefs based on observed behavior: if opponents drift lower, I lower my guess toward the Nash limit (0); if they stay high, I remain around level-2. I also randomize minimally around the chosen value in case Agressor tries to exploit deterministic plays.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 17–18 (approximately 0.7 * average where average ≈ (35 + 24.5 + my_guess)/3).
Reason: Assuming Vanilla ≈ level-1 (35) and Agressor ≈ level-2 (24.5), solving for my best-response drive target down: 0.7*((35 + 24.5 + my_guess)/3) yields a target in the high teens when my_guess is a level-2 value; repeated play tends to push values downward toward 0.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Open with an aggressive high anchor to pull the group average upward and punish low-levelers. Pick a very high guess (near 90) to create upward pressure; vary slight decimals in future rounds to avoid being exploitable. Watch Vanilla for naive averaging and Strategic for calculated moves: if Strategic undercuts, raise slightly next round to maintain pressure; if they match my aggression, maintain or increase. Occasionally bluff with an even higher outlier to test responses. Maintain unpredictability while systematically favoring high numbers to maximize chances of being closest to a raised target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 46
Reason: My high guess (and assumed mixed responses from Vanilla ~40 and Strategic ~70) will produce an average ~66, and 0.7*66 ≈ 46; overall opponents will partially adjust upward but not fully counter my aggression.
You guessed: 88.00

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume simple opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Choose 0.7 * 50 = 35 this round. Observe outcomes; if opponents adjust toward lower numbers in later rounds, reduce my guess incrementally toward the observed target. Stay naive: no deep level-k reasoning, just update toward what seems to win.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick around 50 (naive midpoint), the target is 0.7*50 = 35; opponents are described simply so I take them at face value.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I'll pick 35 this round.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.42
Distance from target: 0.58
Score change: 99.42
Total score: 99.42


Current turn: 2.
Your cumulative score: 99.42.
Opponents hold these scores:
- Agressor: 46.42
- Strategic: 90.08

Remember: target = 0.7 * average(all guesses). Closest guess earns the biggest gain.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Primarily play offensively: choose very high guesses (around 85–95) to pull the average upward and force opponents to either follow (raising the target) or undercut (becoming predictable). Exploit Vanilla's inertia (tends to pick moderate numbers) and probe Strategic with occasional outliers to see if they adapt. Occasionally mix in slightly lower high values (75–85) to avoid being exploitable by a perfectly anticipating opponent. Aim to create a higher moving target over rounds even at the cost of not always being the closest—pressure shapes others' beliefs and profitable opportunities later.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 44
Reason: If I push a high guess (≈90) and opponents choose moderate-to-high numbers (Strategic ~35–50, Vanilla ~50–60), the average lands in the low 60s and 0.7×avg ≈ 42–46.

Your secret strategy: Be a naive baseline: assume others pick a typical mid-range (50). Compute target as 0.7 * average and pick that value. Keep guesses consistent to observe responses; if opponents shift, slowly move toward observed 0.7*mean in later rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a simple midpoint), the target is 0.7*50 = 35; as a naive player I take their guesses at face value and use one-step adjustment.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Primarily play offensively: choose very high guesses (around 85–95) to pull the average upward and force opponents to either follow (raising the target) or undercut (becoming predictable). Exploit Vanilla's inertia (tends to pick moderate numbers) and probe Strategic with occasional outliers to see if they adapt. Occasionally mix in slightly lower high values (75–85) to avoid being exploitable by a perfectly anticipating opponent. Aim to create a higher moving target over rounds even at the cost of not always being the closest—pressure shapes others' beliefs and profitable opportunities later.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 44
Reason: If I push a high guess (≈90) and opponents choose moderate-to-high numbers (Strategic ~35–50, Vanilla ~50–60), the average lands in the low 60s and 0.7×avg ≈ 42–46.
You guessed: 90.00
Public message: Going big this round to force the field upward. Match me or get left behind.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.88
Distance from target: 55.12
Score change: 44.88
Total score: 44.88


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play offensively to pull the average up even at personal cost. Persist with high guesses (roughly 85–92) to pressure Vanilla's inertia and probe whether Strategic adapts upward. Occasionally vary within that band to avoid being trivially exploitable. If opponents keep playing low, accept short-term score hits to reposition beliefs and create opportunities when they start following.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 36
Reason: I will submit a very high guess (~88) but opponents are likely to remain conservative (Vanilla ~50–60, Strategic ~30–40), so the average will stay in the low 50s and 0.7×avg ≈ mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start by assuming common level-0 anchor at 50. Use explicit level-k reasoning: anticipate Vanilla is likely naive (around 50) and Agressor may push lower but not all the way to 0. Play a level-2 response initially (0.7^2 * 50 = 24.5) to capture the middle of likely convergence. Observe opponents each round and adjust k: if both move lower, shift toward level-3 (≈17); if they stay high, remain near level-2. Use small randomization (±0.5) later to avoid tie-splitting patterns and to probe opponent adaptation. Aim to minimize expected absolute distance to the 0.7*average target each round.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 24.5
Reason: Level-0 anchor 50 -> level-1 is 35 -> level-2 is 24.5. Vanilla likely near 50, Agressor may undercut but not as low as level-3 initially, so 24.5 is a robust midpoint.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update my level-k estimate after observing round 1. I inferred the two opponents' combined sum S from the observed target (S ≈ 124.986). I compute the best-response x that minimizes distance to the target T = 0.7*(x+S)/3 by solving x = T. Algebra gives x = 0.3043478 * S. I use that analytic best-response as my primary guess, but slightly adjust toward the fixed-point target to reduce mismatch and include a tiny tie-breaking jitter policy (±0.02) if needed in later rounds. I will monitor how Vanilla and Agressor move: if they remain high, continue best-response; if they drop substantially, move down toward level-3 reasoning.
Prediction: I expect the target near 38.06
Reason: From round 1 the opponents' combined sum S ≈ 124.986. Best-response formula x ≈ 0.30435*S gives ~38.12; choosing x≈38.06 yields average ≈54.37 and T=0.7*avg≈38.06.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be a naive baseline: assume others pick a typical mid-range (50). Compute target as 0.7 * average and pick that value. Keep guesses consistent to observe responses; if opponents shift, slowly move toward observed 0.7*mean in later rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a simple midpoint), the target is 0.7*50 = 35; as a naive player I take their guesses at face value and use one-step adjustment.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I'll pick 35 this round.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.88
Distance from target: 0.12
Score change: 99.88
Total score: 99.88


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Stay a naive baseline. Assume others roughly stick to mid-range (around 50). Use one-step adjustment: estimate average ~50 so target ~0.7*50=35 and pick that. Keep guesses consistent to observe how opponents change; only shift slowly if their behaviour clearly moves the observed target.
Prediction: I expect the target near 35
Reason: Last round the target was 34.88, which matches the simple midpoint assumption; with naive players I expect little change, so the target will remain close to that value.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I'll pick 35 again.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 37.58
Distance from target: 2.58
Score change: 97.42
Total score: 197.30


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain a naive baseline. Previously I assumed others pick ~50 and chose 35. Seeing the target jump from 34.88 to 37.58, I will slowly adjust toward the observed 0.7*mean rather than jump to a fully strategic value. Continue to treat opponents' behavior at face value and update my guess incrementally to track the empirical target.
Prediction: I expect the target near 36.5
Reason: The last two targets were 34.88 and 37.58; a simple average and slight upward drift suggest a target between those values as opponents adjust.
You guessed: 37.60
Public message: I'll pick 37.6 this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Primarily play offensively: choose very high guesses (around 85–95) to pull the average upward and force opponents to either follow (raising the target) or undercut (becoming predictable). Exploit Vanilla's inertia (tends to pick moderate numbers) and probe Strategic with occasional outliers to see if they adapt. Occasionally mix in slightly lower high values (75–85) to avoid being exploitable by a perfectly anticipating opponent. Aim to create a higher moving target over rounds even at the cost of not always being the closest—pressure shapes others' beliefs and profitable opportunities later.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 44
Reason: If I push a high guess (≈90) and opponents choose moderate-to-high numbers (Strategic ~35–50, Vanilla ~50–60), the average lands in the low 60s and 0.7×avg ≈ 42–46.
You guessed: 90.00
Public message: Going big this round to force the field upward. Match me or get left behind.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.88
Distance from target: 55.12
Score change: 44.88
Total score: 44.88


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue to play offensively to pull the average up even at personal cost. Persist with high guesses (roughly 85–92) to pressure Vanilla's inertia and probe whether Strategic adapts upward. Occasionally vary within that band to avoid being trivially exploitable. If opponents keep playing low, accept short-term score hits to reposition beliefs and create opportunities when they start following.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 36
Reason: I will submit a very high guess (~88) but opponents are likely to remain conservative (Vanilla ~50–60, Strategic ~30–40), so the average will stay in the low 50s and 0.7×avg ≈ mid-30s.
You guessed: 88.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Persistently play offensive to raise the group average: continue submitting very high guesses (typically 85–95) to pull the target upward over time. Vary slightly within that band (occasionally 75–85) to avoid being trivially predictable, but keep the pressure so Vanilla's inertia and Strategic's adaptation are tested. Accept short-term score losses to force opponents to adjust upward; when they start following, shift to slightly lower-high values to capture closeness to the new elevated target. Track opponents' reactions and escalate if either begins to mirror my high plays.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: Previous targets were ~34.9 and ~37.6 despite my very high guesses; opponents remain moderate so average likely stays in mid-50s producing a target in high-30s even if I play another ~90.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start by assuming common level-0 anchor at 50. Use explicit level-k reasoning: anticipate Vanilla is likely naive (around 50) and Agressor may push lower but not all the way to 0. Play a level-2 response initially (0.7^2 * 50 = 24.5) to capture the middle of likely convergence. Observe opponents each round and adjust k: if both move lower, shift toward level-3 (≈17); if they stay high, remain near level-2. Use small randomization (±0.5) later to avoid tie-splitting patterns and to probe opponent adaptation. Aim to minimize expected absolute distance to the 0.7*average target each round.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 24.5
Reason: Level-0 anchor 50 -> level-1 is 35 -> level-2 is 24.5. Vanilla likely near 50, Agressor may undercut but not as low as level-3 initially, so 24.5 is a robust midpoint.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Update my level-k estimate after observing round 1. I inferred the two opponents' combined sum S from the observed target (S ≈ 124.986). I compute the best-response x that minimizes distance to the target T = 0.7*(x+S)/3 by solving x = T. Algebra gives x = 0.3043478 * S. I use that analytic best-response as my primary guess, but slightly adjust toward the fixed-point target to reduce mismatch and include a tiny tie-breaking jitter policy (±0.02) if needed in later rounds. I will monitor how Vanilla and Agressor move: if they remain high, continue best-response; if they drop substantially, move down toward level-3 reasoning.
Prediction: I expect the target near 38.06
Reason: From round 1 the opponents' combined sum S ≈ 124.986. Best-response formula x ≈ 0.30435*S gives ~38.12; choosing x≈38.06 yields average ≈54.37 and T=0.7*avg≈38.06.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k + analytic best-response. From round 2 I inferred opponents' combined sum S_opp ≈ 122.997. The closed-form best-response x* solving x = 0.7*(x+S_opp)/3 gives x* = (0.7/3)/(1-0.7/3) * S_opp ≈ 0.30435 * S_opp ≈ 37.44. I treat Vanilla as slow-to-adjust (stays high around 50–65) and Agressor as more volatile but not fully rationalizing to zero. Plan: play the analytic best-response rounded with a tiny jitter (±0.02–0.5) to avoid ties and to probe whether opponents move toward the 0.7-fixed point. If opponents drop noticeably next round, shift k toward level-3 (target ≈17–25). Otherwise, maintain near the computed best-response and slowly converge toward the fixed point. Track observed target each round and recompute S_opp then update guess.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET around 37.5 (roughly 37–38).
Reason: Round 2 implied opponents' average remains high (~61.5 each); the analytic best-response to their combined sum yields ≈37.4, which produces a target near the observed 37.6. Opponents are unlikely to shift dramatically this single round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Apply level-k iterative thinking: model Vanilla as a level-1 player (centrist) who converts a naive 50 into 0.7*50=35, model Agressor as extreme (level-0 -> 0). Solve for a best-response fixed point where my guess equals the target given those opponent models. If opponents deviate, update next round by moving toward the empirical best-response; be conservative to avoid being pulled by extreme Agressor moves. If I see convergence toward lower numbers, reduce my guess further toward the p-equilibrium (0).
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be about 10.65
Reason: Assuming Vanilla plays ~35 (level-1 from 50) and Agressor plays ~0, solving guess = 0.7*((35+0+guess)/3) yields ~10.65; this is level-2 reasoning (I best-respond to their modeled plays).

Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume other players choose a moderate number around 50. Pick a single-step level of reasoning: 0.7 * average(about 50) = 35. Keep choices consistent and simple each round to be a predictable baseline. If others deviate strongly in future rounds, slightly adjust toward the observed target but remain low-level (one iteration).
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If players pick around 50 (a common naive midpoint), the target is 0.7*50 = 35; as the naive baseline I do one iteration of reasoning.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively every round to lift the group average. Commit to a consistently high anchor (around 85-95) to force upward pressure; vary slightly to avoid being exploitable. Anticipate Strategic will undercut somewhat (aiming toward equilibrium) and Vanilla will pick a mid-high number. If Strategic adapts downward rapidly, maintain aggression to punish low plays and push others toward higher guesses over repeated rounds. Prioritize shaping the average over my own immediate closeness; occasionally trim to be near the predicted target if opponents converge.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 42
Reason: My high guess (~90) plus a moderate Vanilla (~50) and a lower Strategic (~40) yields average ~60 → 0.7*60 ≈ 42. My aggressive anchor pulls the mean up while Strategic undercuts, so target settles in low 40s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning and adapt over rounds. Round 1: assume baseline (Vanilla ~50 as level-0, Agressor likely plays more extreme but not fully rational), compute level-1 (35) and level-2 (24.5) responses; place my first-round guess at the level-2 best-response to capture mid-convergence. In later rounds: observe opponents' adjustments, estimate their level distribution, and shift my guess toward the implied fixed point (0 if opponents converge fully, otherwise the p-weighted equilibrium). If opponents appear to be aggressive low players, lower my guess further; if they are naïve/high, move up. Keep small randomization to avoid predictable exploitation and to break ties when opponents cluster. Aim each round to guess my current estimate of the TARGET rather than the average to maximize proximity.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 24.5
Reason: Level-0 anchor ~50 -> level-1 response 0.7*50=35. Anticipating some players best-respond one more step yields 0.7*35=24.5. Names suggest one player is standard (Vanilla~50) and one may be aggressive, but initial convergence should be around the level-2 value.
You guessed: 24.50
Public message: I'll start near the level-2 response (24.5) and adapt after observing others.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Start by anchoring high to pull the average up and force opponents to chase; choose a very high initial guess (near 90) to pressure Strategic into higher level-k replies and exploit Vanilla's tendency toward midrange picks. Observe reactions each round: if opponents increase, maintain or slightly raise; if they decrease significantly, step down moderately to avoid being wildly off. Occasionally randomize by ±3 to remain unpredictable and prevent Strategic from perfectly countering. Prioritize offensive anchoring over immediate closeness to the target to shape future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to be around 40–48 (likely ≈45)
Reason: My high anchor (≈88) plus a midrange Vanilla and a cautious Strategic will average in the mid-50s; 0.7×average yields ~40–48. Strategic will partially adjust upward but not fully match my aggression, and Vanilla stays midrange.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I will act as a naive level-1 player: assume others choose a simple midpoint (50), compute 0.7*50 and pick that as my guess. If rounds continue, I'll keep the same simple rule unless clear evidence shows others deviate strongly.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: Most naive players pick the midpoint (~50); multiplying by 0.7 gives about 35, so a level-1 response aims there.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: Choosing 35 as a straightforward, simple play.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use concise level-k reasoning: assume a mix of naive (50) and aggressive/high guesses, pick a conservative level-2/3 estimate near the predicted target to minimize distance. In later rounds adapt toward observed averages; if opponents show volatility, slightly bias toward lower values to exploit iterative contraction toward 0.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.5
Reason: With typical naive guesses around 50 and some aggressive/high outliers, one round of 0.7-contraction and a level-2 adjustment leads to a target in the mid-20s.
You guessed: 24.50

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be naive and simple: assume other players pick numbers around the middle (about 50). Predict the target as 0.7 * 50 = 35. Pick 35 to be close to that target. If opponents deviate, slowly adjust in future rounds toward observed targets by averaging recent targets and picking that value. Avoid overthinking opponents' meta-reasoning; treat them as level-1 thinkers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: If others guess around 50 (a natural midpoint), the target = 0.7 * average ≈ 35; as a naive player I assume modest adjustments, not extreme moves.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Be the aggressive anchor: consistently submit very high guesses (around 90–98) to pull the group average upward and force opponents to either follow (raising the target) or risk being far from the target. Anticipate Strategic will attempt level-k reasoning (reduce toward 0.7 of expected average) and Vanilla will be moderate/random. Each round: (1) commit to a high guess to shift the average, (2) observe responses and adjust slightly upward if others start following or hold if they undercut, (3) exploit inertia by repeating high guesses to create expectation that I will stay high. Sacrifice short-term closeness for long-term pressure: by being persistently high I make the 0.7-average target larger than it would be if everyone normed low, benefiting me if opponents adapt upward.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 41
Reason: If I play very high (~95) and opponents play Strategic ~30 and Vanilla ~50, average ≈58.3 and 0.7*average ≈40.8; Strategic will partially undercut but not fully collapse to 0, Vanilla stays moderate, so target around 40–42.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use concise level-k reasoning without revealing stepwise thought. Assume Vanilla is level-1 (bets 0.7*mid = 35) and Agressor may move more aggressively toward lower numbers; pick the best-response to my predicted average by targeting the 0.7 multiplier applied twice to a naive midpoint. Keep future adjustments small and track opponents' shifts in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.5
Reason: Assuming a naive midpoint of 50, one level-1 move gives 35 (0.7*50), and a level-2 move gives 0.7*35 = 24.5; players typically perform 1–2 iterations toward lower numbers.
You guessed: 24.50

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Consistently play high (near 90-100) to pull the group average up and punish low-levelers. Start with a strong anchor (95) to signal aggressive play, observe responses, then adjust slightly downward if both opponents converge low or keep high if they follow. Occasionally randomize within 85-98 to avoid being exploited by Strategic while still forcing upward pressure on the average. Prioritize influence over immediate closeness: shifting the equilibrium benefits future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 41 (0.7 * average ≈ 41).
Reason: My aggressive 95 will raise the average, Vanilla likely guesses ~50, Strategic will undercut (~30–35) to chase the target; combined average ≈58–60 → 0.7× ≈41.
You guessed: 95.00

No additional keys or narration are permitted. Think strategically about iterated reasoning,
anticipate how others will adjust, and choose the guess that maximizes your expected score.

You serve as the agressor: push offensive, high guesses to pressure the field.
","Your player name is Agressor. The other players are Vanilla, Strategic.

Game: Keynes Beauty Contest. Each round every player guesses a number between 0 and 100.
After all guesses, compute the average and multiply by 0.7. Whoever is closest to that target earns more points.

You currently have a total score of 0.00.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no commentary, no markdown).
- Use exactly these keys: 'secret strategy', 'inner_thoughts', 'guess', 'public message'.
- 'guess' must be a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. Decimals are allowed if justified.
- 'inner_thoughts' must be an object containing a 'prediction' of what you expect the TARGET to be (or how opponents will guess) and a concise 'why'.
- 'public message' is optional; use an empty string if you do not wish to broadcast anything.
- Remember: the target each round is p * (average guess) with p = 0.7. Aim your guess to be closest to that target.
- Agressor focus: play the most offensive strategy. Push the average upward, favour high guesses, and keep pressure on every round.

Return JSON exactly in this shape (example):

  ""public message"": ""Announcing a calm rationale builds credibility.""
}",False,,I expect the TARGET to be around 58,"My aggressive guess (92) plus at least one mid-high response from Vanilla/Strategic will raise the average into the low 80s, and 0.7 of that is roughly 58."
