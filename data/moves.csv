RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.
You guessed: 24.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.
You guessed: 30.50

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.
You guessed: 88.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35.0
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a naive mid-range), the target is 0.7 * 50 = 35. Players here are described as simple, so no deep iterated elimination is assumed.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use simple level-1 reasoning and update slowly. Assume others start near 50; after seeing the actual target (~34.34) I move my anchor down a bit but remain predictable. I will pick a value close to the recent target so I remain a naive baseline and avoid overreacting to potential adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.0
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34; opponents will likely adjust slightly downward but not fully iterate to zero, so a modest decrease is reasonable.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain a naive level-1 player. Assume others roughly anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly toward the observed target. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.

Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.
You guessed: 88.00

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume simple level-1 reasoning: other players pick a central number (around 50). I respond by picking 0.7 times that central estimate. Keep predictable and steady to serve as a naive baseline. If opponents deviate, update slowly next rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35.0
Reason: If others choose around 50 (a naive mid-range), the target is 0.7 * 50 = 35. Players here are described as simple, so no deep iterated elimination is assumed.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use simple level-1 reasoning and update slowly. Assume others start near 50; after seeing the actual target (~34.34) I move my anchor down a bit but remain predictable. I will pick a value close to the recent target so I remain a naive baseline and avoid overreacting to potential adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.0
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34; opponents will likely adjust slightly downward but not fully iterate to zero, so a modest decrease is reasonable.

Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain a naive level-1 player. Assume others roughly anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly toward the observed target. Do not try to outsmart Strategic or Agressor; instead follow a simple rule: move my guess a small amount toward the last target (around 34) to remain predictable and steady. If opponents shift more, adjust gradually in subsequent rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.5
Reason: Last round's target was ~34.07; opponents are likely to make only small adjustments, so the next target should be slightly lower or around the same.
You guessed: 33.50

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I am a naive level-1 player. Assume others anchor near recent averages and adjust slowly. I won't try to outguess Strategic or Agressor — instead I move my guess a small step toward the most recent observed target each round. This keeps my play predictable and close to the emerging group norm, so I stay competitive without overreacting to possible adversarial moves.
Prediction: I expect the target near 33.2
Reason: Recent targets have hovered ~33.6 and opponents tend to adjust slowly downward; a slight decrease is most likely given the trend.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to drag the average upward and force others to chase higher targets. Open with a very high guess (near the top of the range) to signal aggressive play and test whether Strategic follows or Vanilla stays safe. If opponents rise, maintain high guesses to keep pressure; if they punish by staying low, gradually reduce but remain above the mean of common equilibrium (i.e., > 0.7^2 * 100). Prioritize shaping beliefs over short-term proximity: sacrifice a single-round score to move Strategic toward higher guesses in future rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 40–45 this round.
Reason: Strategic may partially respond to my high signal while Vanilla stays moderate; a high guess from me plus moderate inputs yields an average near ~60, and 0.7 of that is ~42.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue the aggressive pressure: signal high by placing a very large but slightly reduced number from the opener to appear credible while still pulling the group average up. I accept a likely large distance this round to maintain the narrative that high guesses are profitable and to force Strategic to reconsider safe low plays. If Strategic inches upward over the next rounds, sustain elevated guesses; if both opponents punish by staying low repeatedly, gradually step down toward the 0.7^2 equilibrium but remain above conventional levels to preserve offensive posture. Prioritize influencing Strategic's beliefs over a single-round score loss.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 36–38
Reason: I will play high (≈88) and expect Strategic to move slightly up from last round while Vanilla stays moderate/low; that combination yields an average in the low-to-mid 50s and 0.7 of that is ~36–38.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain offensive posture: continue signaling high to pull the group average upward and pressure Strategic to chase. I accept short-term score hits to shape beliefs. On round 3 I reduce slightly from prior extremes to appear somewhat responsive (increase credibility) while still staying well above common equilibria. If Strategic nudges up, sustain high-range guesses (60–90) for 2–3 rounds to cement a new higher reference point; if both opponents stay low repeatedly, gradually step down toward ~49 (0.7*70) over subsequent rounds but never concede to the low 20s. Prioritize influencing Strategic's expectations even at cost of current-round distance; use occasional middling-high moves to avoid being dismissed as irrational.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 33–36
Reason: Both prior rounds produced targets ~34 despite my high plays, so opponents are likely keeping low/moderate guesses; small reduction in my signal won't shift the mean much this round.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume mixed-level opponents and aim to lead convergence toward the Nash equilibrium (0). Use k-level iterative reasoning: model Agressor as slightly higher-level (aggressive undercutting toward lower k) and Vanilla as mid-level (anchors near 35). Compute expected average from those models, place my guess to be closest to 0.7*average. In subsequent rounds adapt by weighting observed guesses: if others fall faster, drop my guess toward the implied fixed point; if they stagnate, nudge downward to exploit predictable bias. Preserve some inertia to avoid overreacting to one-shot noise.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 17.15
Reason: If baseline anchor is 50 (level-0), level-1 -> 35, level-2 -> 24.5, level-3 -> 17.15; opponents likely mix around level-2 to level-3 so target will be close to the level-3 prediction.
You guessed: 17.15
Public message: Playing a level-3 thoughtful move; aiming near 17.15.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with dynamic weighting of observed behavior. Round 1 average implied ~49.1. Treat Vanilla as mid-level (anchored 35–50 but responsive) and Agressor as noisy/undercutting. Expect both to move down next round toward level-2/level-3 reasoning but not all the way to 0. I pick a guess that targets the anticipated 0.7*average. I keep some inertia (don’t swing fully to 0) to avoid being too far if opponents stay high, but I undercut slightly relative to naive level-2 to exploit their likely slow downward adjustment. If opponents drop faster next rounds, I’ll accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they stagnate, I’ll continue nudging down to pull the average lower over iterations.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 24.0
Reason: Observed round 1 average ≈49.1 (target 34.34). Opponents likely respond downward toward level-2/level-3 reasoning; projecting next-round average ≈34–36 gives target ≈0.7*34.5 ≈24.0.
You guessed: 24.00
Public message: Adjusting toward level-3 convergence; aiming near 24.0.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.07
Distance from target: 10.07
Score change: 89.93
Total score: 172.75


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use k-level iterative reasoning with inertia and adaptive weighting of observed behavior. Model Vanilla as mid/high-level who tends to anchor near last target and adjust slowly toward lower k values; model Agressor as noisy/undercutting player who shifts downward but overshoots sometimes. My plan: anticipate a modest downward drift from the repeated ~34 targets, place my guess to be the best response to the predicted average (target = 0.7 * average). Maintain partial inertia so I don't chase one-round noise but nudge downward to pull the average over rounds. If opponents drop faster, accelerate toward the fixed point (0); if they remain near prior levels, keep gradual decrease to exploit their predictability.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 30.5
Reason: Recent two-round targets clustered ~34; opponents likely move slightly downward (Vanilla slow, Agressor variable). Project a modest drop this round from 34 toward the level-3 fixed-point, producing a target around 30–31.
You guessed: 30.50
Public message: Aiming slightly below recent targets to encourage downward convergence toward level-3.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 33.60
Distance from target: 3.10
Score change: 96.90
Total score: 269.65


Recap of Turn 4

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to pull the average up. I will repeatedly choose a very high number (near 90–98) to force the average upward and make the 0.7*average target larger than it would be under conservative play. I assume Vanilla is moderately naive (around 40–60) and Strategic will try to undercut but not go to zero (20–40). By staying consistently high I create pressure: opponents face a tradeoff between matching my aggression (raising the target) or conceding and being far from it. If others adapt upward, I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*average; if they push down, I keep being the aggressive anchor to extract advantage over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to be around 40–45 (rough estimate ~41).
Reason: If I play very high (~95) and Vanilla stays ~50 while Strategic aims lower (~30), average ≈58 and 0.7*average ≈40.8. My high play will push the average up toward this range despite some lower responses.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume other players pick intuitive mid-range numbers. Predict the target as 0.7 * average where average is around 50, so aim directly at 35. Keep my reasoning simple: pick the single number that best responds to a naive average expectation. If opponents shift in later rounds, slowly adjust toward observed target but start at 35.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick roughly 50 (a natural midpoint), 0.7*50 = 35; I'm using low-level reasoning and no deep iterative thinking.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning up to k=3 as a private default; start with a level-0 baseline at 50, compute successive best responses multiplying by 0.7, pick the k=3 response as my guess. In subsequent rounds observe Vanilla and Agressor for deviations and shift k accordingly (if they play higher, move toward k=2; if they undercut, move toward k=4). Avoid revealing adjustments publicly; only communicate a short, non-informative message.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 17.15
Reason: Assuming a baseline (level-0) guess of 50, successive best responses are 35 (k=1), 24.5 (k=2), 17.15 (k=3); opponents typically perform a few iterations rather than full convergence to 0.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning as private baseline. Start from level-0 = 50, compute successive best responses (k1=35, k2=24.5, k3=17.15). After observing round 1 (TARGET=34.34 and opponents averaged very high relative to my 17.15), shift my k slightly upward (toward k=2.5) because opponents appear to undercut full iterative descent but will likely drop from their high guesses. I will pick a guess between my previous k=3 choice and the k=2 response to better center on the anticipated target. Monitor Vanilla and Agressor for pattern: if they move down markedly, move my k down toward 3 or 4; if they remain high, move toward k=2. Keep public message non-informative.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 25
Reason: Opponents averaged very high in round 1, so I forecast they will lower their guesses but not fully converge to k=3; a midpoint adjustment yields a target around 0.7 * average ≈ 25.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Assume other players pick intuitive mid-range numbers. Predict the target as 0.7 * average where average is around 50, so aim directly at 35. Keep my reasoning simple: pick the single number that best responds to a naive average expectation. If opponents shift in later rounds, slowly adjust toward observed target but start at 35.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: If others pick roughly 50 (a natural midpoint), 0.7*50 = 35; I'm using low-level reasoning and no deep iterative thinking.
You guessed: 35.00

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 0.66
Score change: 99.34
Total score: 99.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep reasoning simple: assume others will slightly adjust toward the observed target but stay around mid-low values. Use last round's target as the main anchor (34.34) and make a small conservative adjustment toward it. Do not overthink iterative depth; pick the single best-response to my naive expectation and slowly update in future rounds based on observed targets.
Prediction: I expect the target near 34
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34 and opponents are unlikely to make large shifts given scores; I assume only small adjustments from that anchor.
You guessed: 34.00
Public message: Sticking close to last round's target; keeping it simple.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.07
Distance from target: 0.07
Score change: 99.93
Total score: 199.27


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Keep reasoning minimal and anchored to recent targets. Assume opponents adjust slowly toward the observed target (~34). Use last round's target as the primary anchor and pick the single best-response to that naive expectation. Do not engage in deeper iterated elimination; gradually update if targets move.
Prediction: I expect the target near 34
Reason: Last two rounds produced targets ~34.34 and ~34.07, so opponents are likely to remain close to that area with only small adjustments.
You guessed: 34.00
Public message: Staying close to recent targets; keeping it simple.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning up to k=3 as a private default; start with a level-0 baseline at 50, compute successive best responses multiplying by 0.7, pick the k=3 response as my guess. In subsequent rounds observe Vanilla and Agressor for deviations and shift k accordingly (if they play higher, move toward k=2; if they undercut, move toward k=4). Avoid revealing adjustments publicly; only communicate a short, non-informative message.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 17.15
Reason: Assuming a baseline (level-0) guess of 50, successive best responses are 35 (k=1), 24.5 (k=2), 17.15 (k=3); opponents typically perform a few iterations rather than full convergence to 0.
You guessed: 17.15

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning as private baseline. Start from level-0 = 50, compute successive best responses (k1=35, k2=24.5, k3=17.15). After observing round 1 (TARGET=34.34 and opponents averaged very high relative to my 17.15), shift my k slightly upward (toward k=2.5) because opponents appear to undercut full iterative descent but will likely drop from their high guesses. I will pick a guess between my previous k=3 choice and the k=2 response to better center on the anticipated target. Monitor Vanilla and Agressor for pattern: if they move down markedly, move my k down toward 3 or 4; if they remain high, move toward k=2. Keep public message non-informative.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 25
Reason: Opponents averaged very high in round 1, so I forecast they will lower their guesses but not fully converge to k=3; a midpoint adjustment yields a target around 0.7 * average ≈ 25.
You guessed: 20.00
Public message: Adopting a conservative adjustment between level-2 and level-3 reasoning.

Results of the turn:

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Default to level-k iterative reasoning (k up to 3) starting from level-0 = 50. Observe opponents each round and adjust k: if opponents stay high, move toward k=2; if they drop, move toward k=3+; avoid revealing adaptation. For this round I infer opponents will slightly lower from their very high averages but not fully converge, so I pick an intermediate k around 2.3 (between k=2 and k=3) to minimize expected distance to the 0.7*average target. Continue monitoring patterns to update k next rounds.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 30
Reason: Recent rounds produced targets ~34 indicating opponents averaged high; they’ll likely lower some but not to full k=3, so average drops moderately and 0.7*average falls to roughly 30.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play aggressively to pull the average up. I will repeatedly choose a very high number (near 90–98) to force the average upward and make the 0.7*average target larger than it would be under conservative play. I assume Vanilla is moderately naive (around 40–60) and Strategic will try to undercut but not go to zero (20–40). By staying consistently high I create pressure: opponents face a tradeoff between matching my aggression (raising the target) or conceding and being far from it. If others adapt upward, I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*average; if they push down, I keep being the aggressive anchor to extract advantage over rounds.
Prediction: I expect the target to be around 40–45 (rough estimate ~41).
Reason: If I play very high (~95) and Vanilla stays ~50 while Strategic aims lower (~30), average ≈58 and 0.7*average ≈40.8. My high play will push the average up toward this range despite some lower responses.

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue aggressive anchoring: maintain a very high guess to pull the average upward and force higher targets. I accept short-term point loss to shape opponents' beliefs that I will always play high; this pressures Strategic and Vanilla into raising their guesses over several rounds. If opponents start trending upward, I will slightly lower from extreme highs to better center on 0.7*average; if they hold low, I remain extreme to preserve my role as the upward anchor. I will occasionally pick slightly different highs (e.g., 88–96) to avoid being predictable but stay clearly in the top decile.
Prediction: I expect the target around 38–42 (I'll state 40).
Reason: I remain very high (near 90), Vanilla likely stays moderate (~50) and Strategic may undercut (~30–35); that mix yields an average in the high 50s and 0.7*avg ≈ 40.

Your secret strategy: Persist with an extreme-high anchor (90–98) to force upward pressure on the average. I accept short-term score loss to condition Vanilla and Strategic to raise their guesses over multiple rounds. I will vary within the high band to avoid predictability but stay clearly in the top decile; if opponents drift up noticeably I may trim slightly to better center on 0.7*avg, but for now maintain maximal upward pull.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be around 34–36 (say 35)
Reason: Despite my high plays, opponents have so far held low-to-mid values producing targets ~34. They may nudge upward slowly, but not enough yet to move the target beyond mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Apply level-k reasoning and choose my guess as the fixed point best-response to my model of opponents. I model Vanilla as a level-0 player who guesses 50 (naive midpoint) and Agressor as a level-0 aggressive player who guesses 100. I solve for my best-response g such that g = 0.7 * average(100, 50, g). That yields a self-consistent guess ≈45.6521739. Tactically: start with this fixed-point guess to score well early, observe opponents' adjustments in subsequent rounds, and iteratively lower my guess if both opponents exhibit downward adjustment (toward Nash 0). I will track deviations and move 0.7x of observed average next rounds if opponents become more sophisticated.
Prediction: I expect the target to be about 45.6521739
Reason: Assuming Vanilla = 50 and Agressor = 100 (level-0), the fixed-point best response solves g = 0.7*(100+50+g)/3, giving g ≈45.652. This is a level-2 consistent estimate; opponents may slowly move lower over repeated rounds toward 0, but early-round target should be near this value.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 36.1–36.5 (I'll use 36.3 as central).,"Opponents' inferred mean is ~59–60 each based on recent rounds; plugging that into the empirical best-response fixed-point yields a target in the mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.
You guessed: 88.00

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

You guessed: 35.00

Total score: 196.40


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (≈50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I will stay consistent and not try to outthink opponents; predictably picking 35 each round keeps me near the expected target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: I take others at face value as choosing around 50 and prior targets (34.34, 37.93) are close to 35, so 35 is a simple stable estimate.

Recap of Turn 4

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 approach: assume other players pick a simple midpoint (around 50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35. I will pick 35 to be close to that target. If opponents deviate, I won't overthink; I stick to this simple rule each round to be a predictable baseline.
Prediction: I expect the target to land near 35
Reason: Assuming others choose a midpoint (~50) and applying p=0.7 gives 35; as a naive player I take others at face value and make the straightforward level-1 adjustment.
You guessed: 35.00
Public message: I'll play a simple, consistent strategy: guessing 35.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I stick to this simple, consistent rule each round rather than iterating deeper on opponents' adjustments.
Prediction: I expect the target to be near 34
Reason: Last round's target was 34.34 and opponents' averages appear near 50, so with p=0.7 the target should stay close to 35 (slightly under due to observed 34.34).
You guessed: 35.00

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I use a naive level-1 rule: assume other players pick around the midpoint (≈50). Compute target = 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 to be close to that target. I will stay consistent and not try to outthink opponents; predictably picking 35 each round keeps me near the expected target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 35
Reason: I take others at face value as choosing around 50 and prior targets (34.34, 37.93) are close to 35, so 35 is a simple stable estimate.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35, 35.86) average about 36 and opponents appear roughly centered, so sticking to the level-1 estimate keeps me close.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Score change: 98.36
Total score: 181.18


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 35.3,"Recent targets clustered mid-30s and last target jumped to 35.26; inferred opponent mean ≈56–57 makes the empirical best-response fixed point ≈35–35.5, so a mid-30s target is most likely."

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00

Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

Your secret strategy: I remain a naive level-1 player: assume both opponents pick around the midpoint (~50). Compute target as 0.7 * 50 = 35 and choose 35 each round. I will not iterate on opponents' adjustments and will stay predictable to serve as a baseline.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 36
Reason: Recent targets (34.34, 37.93, 36.35) average about 36 and opponents have been close to midpoint behavior, so the target should stay around mid-30s.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Target (p * average guess): 34.34

Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 35.8,Recent targets have risen to ~35–36 and opponents' inferred means are near mid-50s; the empirical fixed-point best-response given that m implies a mid-30s target (~35.8).

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.

Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.

Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

After all guesses are collected, compute the average of those guesses and multiply it by 0.7.
This value is the TARGET. Players whose guesses are closest to the target earn the most points,
with points decreasing as the distance grows. The contest runs for 10 rounds or until a human ends it early.

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Use level-k iterative reasoning to anticipate convergence toward the 0 Nash equilibrium. Model opponents as: Vanilla = mild level-1 (anchors near 50 then multiplies by 0.7 → ~35), Agressor = more aggressive downward adjuster (level-2 or level-3). I will assume a mix of level-1 and level-2 opponents and place my guess near the level-3 fixed point (0.7^3 * 50 ≈ 17.15). If observed play later shows opponents are higher, I will raise my guess toward their empirical mean*0.7; if they are lower I'll lower further. My private plan: start at 17.15, observe responses each round, estimate opponents' k-levels, then shift my guess toward the empirical best-response to maximize closeness to target.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 17.15
Reason: Level-k reasoning from a naive 50 anchor: level-1 → 35, level-2 → 24.5, level-3 → 17.15. With one player mildly naive (Vanilla) and one aggressive downward adjuster (Agressor), the group average should be around level-2/3 mix giving a target ≈ 17.15.
You guessed: 17.15

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 17.19
Score change: 82.81
Total score: 82.81


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Observed round 1: my low Level-3 guess (17.15) was far below the actual group average; opponents together averaged ≈65. I now treat Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player anchored high (~50–65) and Agressor as a high (possibly zero or adversarial) anchor raising the group mean. I will apply level-k fixed-point best-response reasoning: assume opponents will remain near their observed behavior (~65 each). Solve for my guess x that is a best-response (i.e. x = 0.7 * average(all guesses)). With two opponents at ~65 each this yields x ≈ 39.57. I pick that as a corrective upward move toward the empirical fixed point while remaining ready to adjust in subsequent rounds. If opponents lower next round I'll reduce my guess toward the new empirical best-response; if they stay high I'll remain near this value. My private plan: use this round to move toward the empirical fixed point (~39.6), monitor opponents' reactions, update k-level estimates, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash limit.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to be near 39.6
Reason: Round 1 revealed opponents averaged ≈65. Assuming they maintain similar behavior, the best-response fixed point solving x = 0.7*((65+65+x)/3) is x ≈ 39.57, so the target (0.7*average) will be ≈39.6.
You guessed: 39.57
Public message: Adjusting upward based on observed play; testing an empirical best-response.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 37.93
Distance from target: 1.64
Score change: 98.36
Total score: 181.18


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue level-k iterative reasoning with adaptive empirical updating. From rounds 1–2 opponents averaged ~61.5 each (inferred from targets and my guess). They reduced slightly from round 1 to 2, suggesting mild downward adjustment but not full best-response. I model Vanilla as a mild level-1/level-2 player who moves toward 0.7*anchor slowly, and Agressor as a stubborn/high anchor (or adversarial) who resists lowering. I assume opponents will continue to drift down modestly toward the empirical fixed point rather than instantly best-respond. I choose my guess to be the best-response fixed point given an estimated opponents' mean (~58). This yields x solving x = 0.7*((opp_mean*2 + x)/3) so that my guess equals the target if opponents hold. I will monitor next round: if opponents lower substantially, shift down toward k=3/4 predictions; if they stay high, hold or nudge up slightly. The private plan: pick 35.30 this round (empirical fixed point against opp_mean≈58), observe realized target to update opponents' inferred means and k-levels, then converge toward the dynamically estimated Nash",False,,I expect the TARGET to be about 36.35,"Last round's target (36.24) implies opponent mean ≈59.8; the empirical fixed-point best-response given that m yields x ≈0.6087*m ≈36.3, producing a target ≈36.3–36.4 if opponents hold."

RECENT HISTORY:
Recap of Turn 1

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Play as provocateur: choose consistently high guesses (around 90–100) to drag the average up and pressure opponents to either follow (raising the target) or misplay by staying low. Start with an extreme high (95) to signal aggression, then observe responses: if others drift upward, keep high to exploit higher targets; if they punish by going very low, gradually reduce to ~80 to avoid being irredeemably distant. Use occasional small random jitter (+/- 3) to avoid being predictable to Strategic while keeping pressure on Vanilla. Track round-to-round replies and shift only when clear trends show opponents exploiting my aggression.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET to land near 43
Reason: My aggressive 95 plus one moderate strategic player (~40) and one vanilla (~50) gives an average ~61.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 43; others will likely pick mid-range or mildly adapt rather than fully match my extremity.
You guessed: 95.00
Public message: I'll push the pace — expect high plays. Match me or get left behind.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 34.34
Distance from target: 60.66
Score change: 39.34
Total score: 39.34


Recap of Turn 2

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Maintain provocateur role: keep guesses very high to pull the average up while observing opponents' reactions. After signalling extreme (95) and seeing the target collapse, I will moderate slightly to avoid being completely out of contention but stay clearly offensive. Use guesses around 85–92 with small random jitter (+/-3) to remain unpredictable to Strategic. If opponents drift upward, keep pushing; if they punish by going very low again, I will step down gradually toward ~80 to reduce distance but retain offensive pressure. Track scores to exploit risk-averse players; prioritize disrupting Vanilla who currently leads.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 38
Reason: My high guess will stay well above opponents' typical mid-range plays; average likely between ~54 and ~56 given one aggressive (~88) and two mid players (~45–60), so 0.7*avg ≈ 38–39.
You guessed: 88.00
Public message: Keeping the pressure — play high or get left behind.

Results of the turn:
Target (p * average guess): 37.93
Distance from target: 50.07

Total score: 89.27


Recap of Turn 3

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Continue provocateur role: keep guesses high to pull the average upward and pressure opponents to either follow (increasing the target) or misplay by staying low. After two extreme openings (95 then 88) that left me behind, I slightly temper but remain offensive: pick in the 82–88 band with tiny random jitter to avoid being trivially predictable to Strategic. If opponents respond by rising, stay high to exploit larger targets; if they punish by going very low again, slowly step down toward ~78 over a few rounds to avoid being permanently irrelevant. Monitor scores: Vanilla leads, Strategic close — press them by forcing higher expected targets so their mid-range plays become suboptimal. Use public taunts sparingly to coax Vanilla to chase high numbers.
Prediction: I expect the TARGET near 39.0
Reason: My persistent high guess (~85) combined with two mid-range opponents (Vanilla ~55, Strategic ~45–50) yields an average around 55.7 and 0.7*avg ≈ 39.

Your actions:
Your secret strategy: Remain the provocateur. Keep choosing high numbers to pull the average up and force opponents into difficult tradeoffs: follow me and raise the target (benefiting my relative position) or stay low and be far from the target.
